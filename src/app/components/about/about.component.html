      I hail from the historical city of
      <a class="underline" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekn%C3%A8s" target="_blank">Meknes</a>,
      Morocco—a place I proudly call home. My journey into the tech world has been both unconventional and fascinating,
      fueled by a deep-seated passion for mathematics and problem-solving that I discovered during my
      preparatory classes post-baccalaureate.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a graduate of ENSET Mohammedia, where I specialized as a software engineer with a focus on Software,
      Big Data, and Cloud Computing Engineering. Throughout my academic and professional journey,
      my interests have gravitated towards software development and Artificial Intelligence,
      areas where innovation and creativity meet to change the world as we know it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Off the screen, my life orbits around football, which I both relish watching and playing,
      and chess—a game that has lately captured my fascination for its strategic depth.
      My friends and family are my bedrock, providing me with joy and grounding in equal measure.
      I hold values such as empathy, lean mode, and the pursuit of efficiency close to my heart,
      believing that they are crucial in both personal growth and professional excellence.
      <br />
      <br />
      Here's a fun fact about me: my developer journey has taken me from the simple acts of
      <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/THEXONE17/nodejs" target="_blank">"pushing zip files to GitHub"</a>
      to mastering the art of training AI models and developing sophisticated software solutions.
      This evolution reflects not only the rapid pace of technological advancement but also my commitment to learning, adapting,
      and thriving in the dynamic world of technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      My path to becoming a software engineer was far from linear, yet every step—from my early fascination with mathematics
      to the rigorous training in Big Data and Cloud Computing—has been instrumental in shaping my approach to technology and innovation.
      Today, I leverage my skills, curiosity, and the lessons learned along the way to explore the vast possibilities of software development
      and AI, driven by the belief that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can forge a better future for us all.
      <br />
      <br />
      Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a curious learner, or simply here to share in my journey, I welcome you to my blog.
      Here, I aim to share insights, experiences, and reflections on the ever-evolving landscape of technology, hoping to inspire,
      educate, and connect with like-minded souls across the globe.
      <br />
      <br />
      Remember, in the realm of technology and beyond, the only constant is change, and with a bit of passion, persistence,
      and a willingness to learn, there's no limit to what we can achieve together. Welcome to my world!
